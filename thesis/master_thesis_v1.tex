\section{Introduction}
In this thesis, we construct the mathematical models of students who write
the master's thesis and develop efficient algorithms for writing the master's
thesis based on this model.
By improving the previous study~\cite{suuri2010}, we construct more real models.
Furthermore, we generate this thesis using the proposed algorithms.

\section{Construction of mathematical models}
In this section, we construct the mathematical models of students and
the master's thesis.

\subsection{Modeling of students' motivation}
Let $x(t)$ denote the motivation of a student at time $t$.
In the previous study~\cite{suuri2010}, the following model was proposed:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:student}
  x(t)=x_0 \rme^{-t/a},
\end{equation}
where $x_0$ and $a>0$ are the motivation at $t=0$ and the interest for
the research theme, respectively.
Figure~\ref{fig:student} shows an example of the time evolution of
the model~\eqref{eq:student}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{ampmt_figure.pdf}
  \caption{Example of the time evolution of the model~\eqref{eq:student} with
    $x_0=1$ and $a=1$.}
  \label{fig:student}
\end{figure}

The model~\eqref{eq:student} lacks
\begin{itemize}
\item recovery of the motivation because of the progress of the research
  and tea break;
\item final stretch before the deadline.
\end{itemize}

Let us improve the model~\eqref{eq:student}.

\section{Conclusion}
In this thesis, we have constructed the mathematical models of students
who write the master's thesis.
We have developed efficient algorithms for writing the master's thesis
based on the models and generated this thesis using the proposed algorithms.
The experiments have shown that the proposed algorithms generate the thesis
65536 times more efficiently than writing by oneself.
